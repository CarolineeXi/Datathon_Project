Team: STAT342 Team

## Intro
Drug overdose is not just a statistic—it's a devastating reality that plagues communities across the United States. In 2019 alone, the toll of drug overdose deaths reached a staggering 70,630, marking a 4.8% increase from the previous year. Behind each number lies a story of loss, of shattered dreams, and of futures cut tragically short.

At the heart of this crisis lies the specter of opioids, which have emerged as the primary culprit behind the rising tide of overdose deaths. In 2019, opioids accounted for a staggering 70.6% of all drug overdose deaths—a harrowing statistic that underscores the urgent need for action.

Faced with this sobering reality, the U.S. government has turned to data and analytics in search of answers. They have enlisted you and your team to provide insights that can guide the development of better policies and health interventions—ones that can stem the tide of overdose deaths and offer hope to those struggling with addiction.
